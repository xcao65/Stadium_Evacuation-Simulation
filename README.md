# 6730_A3: Stadium Evacuation Simulation

1.  This is the README file for CSE6730 Assignment 3, Spring 2017.

        Group member: Jing Gu, Xun Cao, Shengji Ye, Xian Li, Zhijie Xie.

2. This project is a simulation for stadium evacuation based on Python programming.

        version: Python 2.7.13

3. To compile the python code,

    start a new bash session, change directory to the root directory, which should contain this README file:

        |--- README

        |--- other .py files including main.py

        |--- new_map.png

        |--- fig --> folder for simulation plots


4.  To get started with the simualtion, use main.py to conduct simulation.

        (Note: some python packages required to be installed before hand to run this simulation.)

        python main.py

    Corresponding plots and results will be printed on screen and bash.
